        <h1>How Javascript works in browsers</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means that it
          runs on the client side, or in other words, in the web browser. When a
          user loads a web page that includes JavaScript code, the web browser's
          has a <b>JavaScript Engine</b> that interprets and executes that code.
        </p>
        <h2>What is JavaScript Engine</h2>
        <p>
          A <b>JavaScript Engine</b> is a computer program that interprets and
          executes JavaScript code. It is responsible for running JavaScript
          programs in web browsers, server-side environments, and other contexts
          where JavaScript is used.
        </p>
        <p>
          When JavaScript code is executed by a JavaScript engine, the following
          processes happen:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Parser:</b> The engine parses the JavaScript code to create an
              abstract syntax tree (AST), which is a representation of the code
              in a format that's easier for the engine to work with.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>AST: </b>In JavaScript, AST stands for Abstract Syntax Tree. It
              is a data structure that represents the source code of a program
              in a hierarchical form( parent-child relationships). The AST is
              generated by parsing the code and breaking it down into its
              individual components, such as variables, functions, statements,
              and expressions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The AST is generated by parsing the code, which involves breaking
              it down into its individual components and creating a tree-like
              structure that represents the structure of the code. Once
              generated, the AST can be used for various purposes, such as code
              analysis, optimization, and transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Developers use ASTs for a variety of purposes, such as analyzing
              code, optimizing code, and transforming code. Tools like Babel and
              TypeScript use ASTs to convert code written in one version of
              JavaScript to another version or to add type annotations to the
              code
            </p>

            <img src="/imges/AST2.png" alt="" width="600px" />
            <p>
              In summary, an AST is a hierarchical representation of the source
              code of a program, which is useful for analyzing, optimizing, and
              transforming code.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Compilation: </b>The engine compiles the AST into machine code,
              which is a low-level representation of the code that can be
              executed by the computer's processor.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Optimization: </b>The engine applies various optimization
              techniques to the compiled code to make it run faster and more
              efficiently. These techniques include things like inlining
              functions, reducing redundant code, and optimizing loops.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Execution: </b>The engine executes the compiled code, running
              it line by line and performing any necessary operations as it
              goes. As the code is executed, it may interact with the Document
              Object Model (DOM) in the case of browser-based JavaScript, or
              other APIs and services depending on the environment it's running
              in.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Garbage Collection: <b></b>The engine tracks which objects in
              memory are no longer being used by the code, and frees up the
              memory they were using in a process called garbage collection.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/imges/jsEngine.png" alt="" width="600px" />
        <p>
          These processes happen very quickly and continuously as the JavaScript
          code is being executed. By optimizing these processes, JavaScript
          engines can execute code faster and more efficiently, which ultimately
          leads to better performance for the applications running on them.

        <h1>Execution Context</h1>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, an execution context is an abstract concept (Entites
          that have not physical or they have no direct representation in the
          physical world) that defines the environment in which JavaScript code
          is executed or An execution context is like a container that holds
          information about a specific section of code as it's being executed.
          It keeps track of things like variables, functions, and objects that
          are in scope, and it also determines the value of the "this" keyword.
          Every time a function is invoked, a new execution context is created,
          which contains information about the function call, such as the value
          of the "this" keyword, the function arguments, and the scope chain.
        </p>
        <p>There are three types of execution contexts in JavaScript</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Global Execution Context: </b> This is
              the default context in which JavaScript code is executed. It
              represents the top-level scope of a JavaScript program and
              contains global variables, functions, and objects.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Global Object: When your JavaScript program starts, the
                global execution context is created automatically by the
                JavaScript engine and added to the execution stack. It contains the global object (e.g.,
                <b>window</b> in the browser or <b>global</b> in Node.js), as
                well as any globally defined variables, functions, and objects.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Outer Environment: The outer environment of the global
                execution context is null because It is the outermost context
                and has no other surrounding context. Therefore, its outer
                environment reference is set to null, since it is the outermost
                context and has no other enclosing context.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The global execution context is always present in the execution
              stack, and it's always at the bottom of the stack. When a function
              is called, a new execution context is created for that function
              and added to the top of the stack.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that any variables or functions that are defined in the
              global context are not enclosed in any other context and are
              globally accessible throughout the program. They are not nested
              inside any other function or block of code, and so they are not
              subject to the scope chain or closure.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Function Execution Context: </b>This is the execution context
              created when a function is called. It contains information about
              the function call, such as the value of the "this" keyword and the
              function arguments. Each function call creates a new function
              execution context.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Eval Execution Context</b>This is the execution context created
              when the "eval" function is called. It allows you to execute
              JavaScript code dynamically, but it is generally considered to be
              a bad practice and should be avoided.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Execuation Stack</h2>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, the execution stack (also called the call stack) is a
          data structure that stores information about the currently executing
          functions. Every time a function is called, a new execution context is
          created and pushed onto the top of the execution stack. When the
          function completes, its execution context is popped off the stack, and
          control returns to the calling function.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's take an example to illustrate how the execution stack works:
        </p>
        <pre><code>function outer() {
  console.log("outer");
  inner();
}

function inner() {
  console.log("inner");
}

outer();</code></pre>
        <p>
          First of all Global Execuation context is created automatically it alwyas at the bottom of the stack and When the outer function is called, a new execution context for <b>outer function</b>
          is created and pushed onto the top of the execution stack. The first
          statement in outer is a call to the console.log function, which
          outputs "outer" to the console. Next, outer calls the inner function,
          so a new execution context for <b>inner</b> is created and pushed onto the
          top of the stack. The first statement in inner is also a call to
          console.log, which outputs "inner" to the console. Once inner
          completes, its execution context is popped off the stack, and control
          returns to outer, which also completes and is popped off the stack.
          Finally, the entire call stack is empty, and the program completes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process continues for each nested function call, creating a stack
          of execution contexts that are resolved in a last-in, first-out (LIFO)
          order.
        </p>
        <p>
          The execution stack is a fundamental concept in JavaScript, as it
          determines the order in which functions are executed and how the
          program flows from one function call to the next. Understanding how
          the execution stack works is crucial for writing correct and efficient
          JavaScript code.
        </p>
        <h2>Why Global Execuation Context is automatically created and added to Execuation Stack</h2>
        <p>The global execution context is automatically created by the JavaScript engine when your code is first run because it represents the overall scope and environment of your entire program. All JavaScript code runs inside this context, and it's used to define global variables and functions that are accessible throughout your program.

        </p>
        <p>Creating the global execution context at the beginning of your program ensures that all globally defined variables and functions are available before any other code is executed. This means that you can define global variables and functions at the top of your file or script, and then use them in any other part of your program.

        </p>
        <p>Additionally, by creating the global execution context as the first context in the execution stack, it ensures that all other contexts created during the execution of your program have access to the global scope. This allows functions defined in different contexts to reference and modify global variables and functions as needed.

        </p>
        <p>So, the global execution context is created automatically in the execution stack to provide a consistent and predictable environment for your JavaScript program, and to ensure that globally defined variables and functions are available throughout your program.
